Lecturers: Johannes Henn, David Kosower, Claude Duhr, Oliver Schlotterer, Gleb Arutyunov.
Description: The school puts special emphasis on scattering amplitudes in gauge and string theories, and is primarily aimed at early-stage researchers and advanced masters students, with the intention to bridge the gap between textbook material and the forefront of current research. Knowledge in quantum field theory and the basics of string theory is assumed. The school is the first training event organized by the SAGEX Innovative Training Network of the European Commission. At the same time it also continues the "String Steilkurs" series, an intensive course in string theory and mathematical physics that is organized by DESY and the University of Hamburg.
Tags: I was hoping you could add some relevant tags here, since you know what the lectures were about!
